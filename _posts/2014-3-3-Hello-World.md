I hope you enjoy this wild ride that I'm gonna take you on. I'm gonna use this to be pretty much loose and informal about all the stuff I do regarding programming, school and life in general. My first actual post will come soon, until then, just stick around and relax, grab some popcorn cause we're going on a trip (In our favorite rocket shi.... I'll stop now)

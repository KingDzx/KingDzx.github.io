Now, please welcome to the stage, SimplePythonRPG! **cheers and claps erupt in the backgroud**

![RPG!]({{"/images/StartingUp.png" | absolute_url}})

So this is a project that I started over the vacation. It's my very first project and I'm not going to lie, it was so much fun to do and it pushed my creativity to new limits that I never thought imaginable. The game takes a lot of inspiration from other games, such as Pokemon, League, WoW and small bits here and there. Most of the calculations were "borrowed" from Pokemon (plz don't sue me), classes and subclasses were inspired by WoW and League and stats and abilities are also inspiried from league.

In the next post, i'll go more indepth into the code itself to show what I have managed to acomplish alongside how it was done.

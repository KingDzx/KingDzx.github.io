Hey there! These series of post deal with my team and I's software engineering 2 project.

In this post, I'm going to go over the most recent meetings with our group.

In the lastest meeting, we discussed on how we wish to do our workflow regarding the project. We thought that as we weren't doing much, we would have days where we physically meet up and do our work together. This idea is honestly a great idea, as it will allow for more work to be done as well as facilitate a meeting point for our SCRUM meetings as well. Other than that, I need to learn Firebase which may take some work but I believe that I can get it done. I believe that our team can complete this project, and hopefully have a lot of people use our application.
